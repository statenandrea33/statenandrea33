### Andrea Staten
 I am a Senior at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I am currently pursuing a degree in Geographic Information Science and Technology with a minor in Political Science. With this degree I am hoping to get a job working for a local county or potentially a non-profit to make an impact on evironmental issues.
